# evolutionary algorithm: string guesser

It is designed for automatic self-improvement over time until it finally guesses the given string corretly.

## example program output
```
Generation 28400 developed from fitness value '2914' to '2885' -> DNS: 'This moaent when'kor"dUnt rem\mbee how a plrd im6writsek correcjZy so you just try every%possiblW c]mbination.'

37553 generations where needed to archieve goal.
13,96% of all generations could develop themselves.

Solution: 'This moment when you dont remember how a word is written correctly so you just try every possible combination.'
